# Project to practice Cucumber and Selenium using Java

This project is based on ["Learning Selenium"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-selenium/using-the-api-2?pathUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A57f7e27c3dd559e018dfe994) course by Meaghan Lewis. The goal is test the [blog](https://selenium-blog.herokuapp.com/)'s sign up feature. But she used Ruby, gem and rspec. And I used java, maven, junit and cucumber. 

I started this project based on [Cucumber-Java Skeleton](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton)

The insert the Firefix driver to class path was used the following commands:
```sh
learning-selenium-cucumber$ echo $PATH
learning-selenium-cucumber$ export PATH=$PATH:<path to>/geckodriver-v0.26.0-linux64
learning-selenium-cucumber$ echo $PATH
```
